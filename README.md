## About

This font is my fork of a splendid Cozette font by Slavfox. Sadly, the author
is busy with real life and cannot review my PR for a long time. So I decided
to make my personal edits to this font public.

I have added a lot of extra glyphs and redesigned a few. I'm lazy and don't
document my changes thouroughly, but I do commit frequently and make a lot of
branches (from 2022-06-01 not so true anymore). So, feel free to get whatever
branch or commit you want and build it for yourself.

I build only `.ttf`, because I'm using Windows, and upload them in Release
section.

### 2022-06-01

I have decided to stop branching and from now on will put all of my changes in
`master`.
